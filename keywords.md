## Recommended Content Strategy

### Tier 1: Competitor Capture Pages (Fastest wins, highest intent)

Create dedicated comparison pages for every competitor brand keyword with 100+ monthly searches:
- "Claude Code vs Cursor" — target developers considering switching
- "Claude Code vs GitHub Copilot" — capture the incumbent's audience
- "[Competitor] alternative for marketers" — reframe the category for non-engineers

**Why this works for our persona:** PMMs evaluating AI tools search competitor names first. Intercepting these searches with PMM-focused messaging ("you don't need to be an engineer") converts better than generic developer comparisons.

### Tier 2: PMM Use-Case Content (Lowest competition, highest relevance)

Write how-to and use-case content targeting PMM-specific workflows:
- "How to automate competitor tracking with AI"
- "AI tools for sales enablement and battlecards"
- "Build a landing page with AI (no coding required)"
- "AI for win/loss analysis"

**Why this works:** These terms have low competition because every AI coding tool markets to engineers. We own the non-engineer angle. Each piece should embed a Claude Code demo or link to the ROI calculator.

### Tier 3: Category Landing Pages (Highest volume, long-term play)

Build SEO-optimized pillar pages for high-volume category terms:
- "Best AI marketing tools [year]"
- "AI coding tools comparison"
- "AI tools for product managers"
- "No-code AI tools"

**Why this works:** These pages take months to rank but drive sustained traffic. Position Claude Code as "the AI tool for people who aren't engineers" within broader listicles.

### Tier 4: High-Intent Bottom-of-Funnel (Highest conversion)

For any keyword with CPC >= $4, create dedicated landing pages with:
- The ROI calculator embedded
- A PMM-specific demo video or terminal recording
- Direct CTA to try Claude Code

**Why this works:** High CPC = buyers ready to purchase. A single #1 organic ranking on a $8 CPC keyword with 500 searches/mo saves $4,000/mo in ad spend and converts at higher rates than paid.
