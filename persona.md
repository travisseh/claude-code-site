# Target Buyer Persona

## Profile

- **Role:** Product Marketing Manager
- **Company stage:** Series B SaaS (50-200 employees, $10-50M ARR)
- **Experience:** 3-5 years in PMM or adjacent roles (content marketing, demand gen, product management)
- **Location:** Remote or hybrid; works closely with product and sales teams across time zones

## AI Usage

- Uses ChatGPT daily for drafting copy, brainstorming positioning, summarizing competitive intel
- Has not tried coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- Assumes "AI coding tools" = "tools for software engineers" and self-selects out
- Comfortable with no-code tools (Zapier, Webflow, Notion) but has never opened a terminal

## Core Skepticism

"I'm not a developer. Why would I need a coding tool?"

- Believes there's a hard line between "technical" and "non-technical" work
- Doesn't realize that building landing pages, parsing CSVs, automating workflows, and creating internal dashboards are all things Claude Code can do conversationally
- Has been burned by past "no-code" promises that hit walls quickly
- Needs proof that the learning curve is minutes, not months

## What They Care About

- **Pipeline contribution:** Everything maps back to "did this help source or accelerate pipeline?" Anything that doesn't connect to revenue feels like a distraction
- **Competitive intel:** Spends hours manually tracking competitor pricing pages, feature launches, G2 reviews, and changelog updates. Would kill for automation here
- **Content velocity:** Under constant pressure to ship more battlecards, one-pagers, blog posts, and sales enablement assets. Always behind on the content calendar
- **Cross-functional credibility:** Wants to be seen as strategic by product and eng, not just "the messaging person"

## Frustrations

- Files tickets for simple internal tools (competitor tracking sheets, ROI calculators, landing page tweaks) and waits weeks
- Spends 30% of time on manual data wrangling that feels like it should be automated
- Knows the company's data could tell a better story but can't access or analyze it without bothering an analyst
- Feels like AI is transforming every function except hers in any meaningful, durable way

## What Would Convert Them

- A concrete example of a PMM using Claude Code to do something they currently do manually (e.g., "I built a competitor pricing tracker in 20 minutes")
- Seeing the conversational interface — realizing it's closer to ChatGPT than to VS Code
- A use case that connects directly to pipeline or content output, not a generic "build a website" demo
- Social proof from peers at similar-stage companies, not from engineers

## Messaging Principles for This Persona

- **Lead with the outcome, not the tool.** "Ship a competitive battlecard site in an afternoon" not "Learn to use a CLI"
- **Reframe "coding" as "building."** They already build — decks, campaigns, strategies. This is just a faster way to build digital things
- **Acknowledge the skepticism directly.** "You're not an engineer. That's the point." earns more trust than pretending the objection doesn't exist
- **Show, don't tell.** A 30-second terminal recording of a PMM-relevant task will convert better than 500 words of copy
