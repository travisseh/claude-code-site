          <p>You don't need to understand React or CSS. Tell Claude Code what you need &mdash; "Build a pricing comparison page for our top 5 competitors" &mdash; and it handles every file, every line, every detail. You review the output, not the implementation.</p>

          <p>Start a task in Slack. Refine it in the desktop app. Deploy from your terminal. Claude Code is the same agent everywhere. Cursor only works inside Cursor. For a PMM bouncing between tools all day, that distinction matters.</p>

      <div class="section-heading reveal reveal-delay-1">The questions you're actually asking</div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">Is Cursor easier to learn than Claude Code?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            <div class="faq-a-inner">
              It depends on what you mean by "learn." Cursor looks like a code editor, so if you've used VS Code or Sublime Text, it'll feel familiar. But you're still working inside an IDE, which means navigating file trees, understanding project structures, and reading diffs. Claude Code asks you to type a sentence describing what you want. For product marketers, describing outcomes in plain English is already your job. The terminal might look unfamiliar, but the interaction model is simpler. And with the desktop app, you don't even need the terminal.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">Can Cursor do everything Claude Code can?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            <div class="faq-a-inner">
              Not quite. Cursor is outstanding at inline code completion and visual editing &mdash; it's the best autocomplete tool on the market. But Claude Code is more autonomous. It can read your entire codebase, execute multi-step tasks, run its own commands, and work across terminal, IDE, desktop, web, and Slack. Cursor is limited to the Cursor IDE. For tasks like "build me a competitor tracker from scratch," Claude Code handles the full lifecycle while Cursor works better as a co-pilot for existing code.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">Do I need a Claude subscription AND a Cursor subscription?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            <div class="faq-a-inner">
              You only need one. Claude Code comes with your Claude Pro subscription ($20/mo), which also gives you access to Claude for writing, research, and analysis &mdash; tools you probably already use. Cursor requires its own subscription ($20&ndash;$200/mo depending on usage), and it's a separate product. If you're already paying for Claude Pro, Claude Code is included at no extra cost.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-q">What about Cursor's free tier? Can I start there?</div>
          <div class="faq-a">
            <div class="faq-a-inner">
              Cursor does offer a limited free tier, and it's worth trying. But the free version restricts model access and usage limits quickly. More importantly, Cursor's free tier trains you on IDE-based workflows. If you're a product marketer, that's learning a tool designed for engineers. Claude Code's $20/mo entry point gives you the full agent experience from day one, plus access to Claude for all your non-coding work.

          <div class="faq-a">
            <div class="faq-a-inner">
              If your goal is to learn software engineering, Cursor is a reasonable environment because it exposes you to code as you work. But most PMMs don't want to become engineers &mdash; they want to ship things faster. Claude Code lets you build real tools and pages without requiring you to understand the underlying code. You'll naturally pick up concepts as you go, but the learning is incidental, not required. Start by building things. The understanding follows.
