    <h2>Why This Comparison Matters for Non-Engineers</h2>

    <p>If you search "Claude Code vs Cursor," every result you'll find is written by developers, for developers. They'll compare token limits, model switching, and autocomplete latency. Useful information &mdash; if you're an engineer.</p>

    <p>But you're probably not. You're a product marketer at a Series B SaaS company. You spend your weeks building battlecards, pulling competitive intel, coordinating landing pages with design, and filing Jira tickets for tools that should take an afternoon to build. You've heard that <a href="/ai-tools-non-engineers.html">AI coding tools can help non-engineers ship real things</a>, and now you're trying to figure out which one to try.</p>

    <p>This comparison is for you. We're going to evaluate Claude Code and Cursor through the lens of what PMMs actually need: the ability to describe what you want in plain English and get a working result you can share, deploy, or hand to your team.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>What Is Cursor?</h2>

    <p>Cursor is an AI-powered code editor. Technically, it's a fork of VS Code (the most popular code editor in the world) with AI capabilities baked into every surface. It launched in 2023 and quickly became the default recommendation for "AI coding."</p>

    <p>Here's what makes it good:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tab autocomplete</strong> &mdash; As you type code, Cursor predicts what comes next and fills it in. It's fast, accurate, and genuinely saves engineers hours per week. This is Cursor's strongest feature.</li>
      <li><strong>Chat + Composer</strong> &mdash; You can ask Cursor questions about your codebase or use Composer mode to make multi-file changes with natural language instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Agent mode</strong> &mdash; A newer capability where Cursor autonomously writes and edits code to complete tasks. It's good, but it's still catching up to dedicated agentic tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-model support</strong> &mdash; Cursor works with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and other models. You're not locked into one provider.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free (limited), $20/mo (Pro), $60/mo (Pro+), $200/mo (Ultra). There's also a $40/user/mo team plan.</p>

    <p>Cursor is, without question, the best AI-enhanced code editor on the market. If you're a software engineer writing code every day, it's excellent. The question is whether a code editor is what you need.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>What Is Claude Code?</h2>

    <p>Claude Code is Anthropic's agentic coding tool. Unlike Cursor, it's not an editor &mdash; it's an agent that reads your entire codebase, writes files, runs commands, and tests its own work. You interact with it by describing what you want, and it handles the implementation.</p>

    <p>Here's what makes it different:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Natural language as the interface</strong> &mdash; You don't edit code alongside Claude Code. You tell it what to build, and it builds it. "Create a competitive pricing comparison page" is a valid instruction.</li>
      <li><strong>Works everywhere</strong> &mdash; Terminal, VS Code, JetBrains, a standalone desktop app, web browser, and Slack. Same agent, same capabilities, every surface.</li>
      <li><strong>CLAUDE.md for persistent context</strong> &mdash; Create a file with your brand guidelines, competitor list, and project preferences. Claude Code reads it automatically in every session. Like onboarding a teammate who never forgets.</li>
      <li><strong>Shell composability</strong> &mdash; Because it runs in your terminal, you can pipe output to other tools, chain tasks, and integrate it into automation workflows.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> $20/mo with a Claude Pro subscription, which also gives you access to Claude for writing, research, and analysis.</p>

    <p>Claude Code isn't trying to be a better code editor. It's trying to be a building tool that works for <a href="/ai-product-marketing-tools.html">anyone who can describe what they need</a> &mdash; including people who have never opened a code editor in their lives.</p>

    <h2>Head-to-Head: What Matters for Product Marketers</h2>

    <p>Let's break this down across the dimensions that actually affect your workflow.</p>

    <h3>1. Getting Started</h3>

    <p><strong>Cursor</strong> asks you to download an application, open a project folder, and navigate an IDE. If you've used VS Code, it's familiar. If you haven't, it's a learning curve &mdash; file trees, integrated terminals, settings panels, extension marketplaces. It's a developer tool that happens to have AI in it.</p>

    <p><strong>Claude Code</strong> asks you to open a terminal (or the desktop app) and type a sentence. That's it. The unfamiliar part is the terminal itself, which looks intimidating if you've never used one. But the actual interaction &mdash; describing what you want &mdash; is something PMMs do dozens of times a day in Slack, email, and briefs.</p>

    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Cursor has a more familiar visual interface. Claude Code has a simpler interaction model. If "type what you want" sounds easier than "learn an IDE," Claude Code wins here.</p>

    <h3>2. What You Can Build</h3>

    <p><strong>Cursor</strong> is strongest when you're editing existing code. Need to tweak a landing page? Change copy on a feature page? Fix a CSS issue? Cursor's autocomplete and inline editing are excellent for incremental changes.</p>

    <p><strong>Claude Code</strong> is strongest for building from scratch. "Create a competitor comparison page with these 6 companies" is a single conversation. It reads your existing site's styles, creates the HTML, writes the CSS, and gives you a working file. For the types of things PMMs need &mdash; <a href="/ai-competitor-tracker.html">competitor trackers</a>, landing page variants, ROI calculators, battlecard sites &mdash; Claude Code handles the full lifecycle.</p>

    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If you're editing code, Cursor. If you're building things from a description, Claude Code.</p>

    <h3>3. Autonomy Level</h3>

    <p><strong>Cursor</strong> works best as a copilot. It suggests completions, answers questions, and makes edits you review. Agent mode is improving, but the core experience is collaborative editing &mdash; you and the AI working together on code.</p>

    <p><strong>Claude Code</strong> is built to work independently. Give it a task and walk away. It reads your codebase for context, plans the work, writes the files, runs commands to test its output, and reports back when it's done. For a PMM who doesn't want to supervise code being written, this level of autonomy is the point.</p>

    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Claude Code is significantly more autonomous. If you want to delegate tasks rather than collaborate on code, this is where Claude Code pulls ahead.</p>

    <h3>4. Where It Lives</h3>

    <p><strong>Cursor</strong> is the Cursor IDE. Full stop. You open Cursor, you work in Cursor, you close Cursor. It doesn't exist outside its application window.</p>

    <p><strong>Claude Code</strong> runs in your terminal, in VS Code, in JetBrains, as a standalone desktop app, in your web browser, and in Slack. Start a task in Slack with a quick prompt. Refine it in the desktop app. The same agent, the same context, everywhere.</p>

    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For PMMs who live in Slack, browsers, and five other tools simultaneously, Claude Code's multi-surface availability is a major advantage. Cursor requires you to context-switch into a dedicated coding environment.</p>

    <h3>5. Project Memory</h3>

    <p><strong>Cursor</strong> indexes your codebase and maintains chat history. It understands your project's structure and can reference files across your repo. But the context is session-based &mdash; it doesn't carry persistent preferences or instructions between sessions unless you repeat them.</p>

    <p><strong>Claude Code</strong> uses CLAUDE.md files for persistent project context. Write your brand guidelines, competitor list, data sources, and tone preferences once. Every future conversation automatically includes that context. For a PMM who wants consistency across builds &mdash; "always use our brand orange," "include the standard CTA," "reference our pricing page" &mdash; this is transformative.</p>

    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Claude Code's CLAUDE.md system is a clear advantage for anyone who wants repeatable, brand-consistent output.</p>

    <h3>6. Price and Value</h3>

    <p><strong>Cursor</strong> starts at $20/mo (Pro) and goes up to $200/mo for heavy usage. That's a single-purpose tool cost.</p>

    <p><strong>Claude Code</strong> is included in your $20/mo Claude Pro subscription, which also gives you Claude for writing, research, analysis, brainstorming, and everything else. If you're already paying for Claude (and many PMMs are), Claude Code is free incremental value.</p>

    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Dollar for dollar, Claude Code delivers more breadth. You're not paying for a coding tool &mdash; you're paying for an AI assistant that also builds things. Check the <a href="/#calculator">ROI calculator</a> to see what the time savings look like for your workflow.</p>

    <h2>Where Cursor Wins</h2>

    <p>Let's be honest about what Cursor does better.</p>

    <p><strong>Autocomplete is unmatched.</strong> If you're writing or editing code line by line, Cursor's tab completion is the best in the industry. It predicts what you'll type next with eerie accuracy. Claude Code has nothing equivalent because it's not designed for keystroke-level editing.</p>

    <p><strong>The visual IDE is less intimidating for some people.</strong> A code editor with a file tree, syntax highlighting, and a chat sidebar feels more "normal" than a terminal window with blinking text. If the terminal genuinely scares you and you'd rather ease in through a visual interface, Cursor provides that on-ramp.</p>

    <p><strong>Multi-model support offers flexibility.</strong> Cursor lets you switch between OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and other models. If Claude's model has a weakness for a specific task, you can swap to GPT-4o or Gemini mid-conversation. Claude Code runs on Claude models only.</p>

    <p><strong>Composer mode for multi-file editing is polished.</strong> When you need to refactor across several files simultaneously, Cursor's Composer shows you visual diffs in real time. It's a refined experience for code editing specifically.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Where Claude Code Wins</h2>

    <p>And here's where Claude Code pulls ahead for the PMM persona.</p>

    <p><strong>Multi-surface availability is a category of one.</strong> No other AI coding tool works in the terminal, two IDEs, a desktop app, a web browser, and Slack. For a PMM who doesn't want to learn a new IDE, the desktop app or Slack integration alone make Claude Code accessible in ways Cursor isn't.</p>

    <p><strong>Agentic depth is unmatched.</strong> Claude Code doesn't just suggest edits. It plans tasks, reads your entire project for context, writes files, executes shell commands, runs tests, and iterates on its own mistakes. For the kinds of tasks PMMs care about &mdash; "build me a thing" rather than "help me edit this code" &mdash; the agentic approach is fundamentally better.</p>

    <p><strong>CLAUDE.md is a competitive moat.</strong> Persistent project context sounds minor until you've used it. Write your brand guidelines, your competitor list, your preferred CTA text, and your company's tone of voice into one file. Every future conversation inherits all of it. No other tool has an equivalent.</p>

    <p><strong>Terminal composability unlocks automation.</strong> This one might not matter to you today, but it will. Claude Code's output can be piped to other tools, chained in scripts, and integrated into workflows. Once you've built your first competitor tracker, the next step is automating the update cycle &mdash; and Claude Code's Unix-native design makes that possible in ways an IDE tool can't.</p>

    <p><strong>The subscription includes everything else Claude does.</strong> Your $20/mo isn't just for coding. It's for writing briefs, analyzing win/loss data, brainstorming positioning, summarizing call recordings, and everything else Claude handles. Cursor's $20/mo buys you a code editor.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The PMM Verdict</h2>

    <p>Here's the honest recommendation.</p>

    <p>If you're a product marketer who wants to <strong>build things</strong> &mdash; competitor trackers, landing pages, ROI calculators, internal tools &mdash; without learning software engineering, <strong>Claude Code is the better choice.</strong> Its natural language interface, agentic autonomy, and multi-surface availability are designed for the way you already work.</p>

    <p>If you're a product marketer who wants to <strong>learn to code</strong> or who already works inside VS Code regularly, Cursor is a great tool. Its autocomplete and visual editing are genuinely best-in-class.</p>

    <p>But for the majority of PMMs at Series B SaaS companies &mdash; the ones filing Jira tickets for landing pages, manually updating competitor spreadsheets, and waiting on engineering for simple internal tools &mdash; Claude Code solves the right problem. It doesn't teach you to code. It makes coding irrelevant.</p>

    <blockquote>You're not an engineer. That's the point.</blockquote>

    <p>The goal isn't to become more technical. The goal is to ship the competitive intel page, the campaign landing page, the sales enablement tool &mdash; all the things you've been blocked on &mdash; before your next standup.</p>

    <p>Claude Code lets you do that. Today. In plain English.</p>
